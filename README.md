Lemonade is a downstream frontend for
[bergamot](https://github.com/browsermt/bergamot-translator).  The idea is to have a linux system wide translation-service, which multiple
applications use (iBus, WebExtension) etc, this providing the
translation-service locally addressing many privacy concerns discussed in
https://browser.mt/. 

For library, cross-platfrom, configurability look at the applications offered
by [bergamot-translator](https://github.com/browsermt/bergamot-translator).
You might also want to checkout
[translateLocally](https://github.com/XapaJIaMnu/translateLocally), which is
cross-platform and GUI.
